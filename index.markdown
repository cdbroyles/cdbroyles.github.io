# Chris Broyles
**Problem Solver | Collaborative Thinker | Aspiring Software Developer**

Hello! I'm Chris Broyles. I am an analytical and detail oriented professional with a strong foundation in mathematics and software development. After teaching mathematics classes up to Calculus 3 and currently working as a Material Estimator at Boeing, I'm transitioning into software development to apply my problem solving skills in building innovative solutions.

I have completed extensive full-stack training through LaunchCode that includes hands on experience in Java, JavaScript, React, Spring Boot, and mySQL. I also have a personal project where I used Python to controll individually addressable LED lights.  I have learned how to design scalable systems, write clean and maintainable code, and collaborate with teams to solve complex challenges.
